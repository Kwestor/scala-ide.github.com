* [JDK 5][jdk5] or [JDK 6][jdk6] ([JDK 7][jdk7] can be used but there have been issues reported when using Eclipse 3.7 with Java 7, e.g., [1][issue-1-jdk7] or or [2][issue-2-jdk7] if you are on MacOSX - a workaround for the latter issue is described [here][workaround-issue-2-jdk7]).

* Eclipse, including the JDT. "Eclipse Classic" is sufficient, but [any Eclipse package can be used][eclipse-package-to-use].

	* Both [Eclipse 3.6 (Helios)][eclipse-helios] and [Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)][eclipse-indigo] are supported.
