    <h4>Highlight Implicits <span class="label success">Available</span></h4>
	Implicit definitions are a powerful Scala construct, but it is often hard to guess when they are applied. With Implicit Highlight you get immediate visual feedback in the editor and, by pressing <span class="keystroke">Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+1</span>, turn an implicit into an explicit call!

    <h4>Semantic Highlighting</h4>
    <span class="label warning">Coming Soon</span><br/>
	Identifiers are colored based on their meaning, improving readability. For instance, a <span class="code">val</span> can be colored differently from a <span class="code">var</span> and a <span class="code">lazy val</span>!
