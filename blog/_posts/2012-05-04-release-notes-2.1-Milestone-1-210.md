title: Scala IDE 2.1 Special Edition for 2.10.0-M3

---

Today we released an early preview of the Scala IDE V2.1 for Eclipse, based on the new milestone
for the upcoming [Scala][scala] 2.10! This release has all the new features in the Scala IDE M1, 
plus a few minor changes needed in order to support 2.10.

You can see the [Release Notes for M1][release-notes-m1] to check the new features in the Scala IDE,
and the [Scala Change Log][changelog-scala-m3] for what's new in Scala 2.10.


## Install it now!

This special edition works with 
[Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)][indigo]. We developed and tested it using Java 6, but Java 7 can be used 
[with some caveats][ide-java7].

We hope you will enjoy using it and, please, let us know what you think. This is the perfect time to help us 
with ideas and improvement suggestions, or just contribute them.
