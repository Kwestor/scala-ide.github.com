title: Scala IDE 2.1 Special Edition for 2.10.0-M5

---

Today we released another edition of the Scala IDE V2.1 for Eclipse, based on the latest milestone
for the upcoming [Scala][scala] 2.10! This release is a development snapshot from the upcoming 2.1
release of the IDE, having all the features in the [M1 release][release-notes-m1].

With milestone 5 the Scala compiler enters the feature freeze phase of the 2.10.0 release. This is
the best time to try out all the exciting upcoming features: reflection, the Java 6 backend, 
string interpolation, the new futures API, the new pattern matcher and macros. A full list of the
new features is available on the [Scala M5 Change Log][changelog-scala-m5]

You can see the [Release Notes for M1][release-notes-m1] to check the new features in the Scala IDE.

This special edition works with 
[Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)][indigo]. We developed and tested it using Java 6, but Java 7 can be used 
[with some caveats][ide-java7].

We hope you will enjoy using it and, please, let us know what you think. This is the perfect time to help us 
with ideas and improvement suggestions, or just contribute them.
