title: New Worksheet Release
author: Scala IDE team
---

Today we are announcing a new release of the Scala Worksheet, V0.1.2, available for the Scala IDE 
V2.1-M2 for both Scala 2.9 and 2.10.0-RC1. It brings to the table an important number 
of fixes related to worksheet instrumentation. And, it can now be installed on 
both Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) and Eclipse 4.2 (Juno)! 

Update is recommended for all users.

## New and Noteworthy

Let's have a quick round at what happened in the past month.

### Worksheet Instrumentation

The instrumentation component is responsible of producing the worksheet output, which is 
the one thing that you, worksheet aficionados, really care about. With the previous 
release, it could happen that perfectly fine Scala code was reported as being erroneous 
in the worksheet. We considered these issues critical, and we have been working hard to 
fix all known problems. It should now be much harder to get the worksheet in a state 
where incorrect errors are reported. But, if you see any, please make sure to file a 
ticket in our [issue tracker][issue-tracker].

### Editor cut-off value is now per-evaluation

In the Worksheet preferences, you can set the maximum number of output characters to be 
shown after evaluation. Limiting the output is particularly useful when you are 
manipulating large data sets. For instance, when mapping elements, you mentally check the 
transformation is correct only for a small sample of the input data. Now, you are free to 
set the cut-off value that better suits and the worksheet output of each expression is 
adapted accordingly.

### Changelog

* Mac-osx fresh install worksheet wont evaluate anything. [#85][#85]
* Error squigglies are not removed/added all the time. [#84][#84]
* Multiple top-level objects will cause errors: not found $skip and not found $show. [#64][#64]
* Decode special names, as in val * = 3. [#62][#62]

## Install Now

The released worksheet depends on the [Scala IDE V2.1.0-M2][ide-2.1.0-m2]. Therefore, make 
sure you have the it installed, and then, *using the same update site*, install the 
worksheet. The worksheet plug-in is listed under the ``Scala IDE plugins`` section.

If you are having trouble with the installation, have a look at our [Getting Started page][getting-started].  
For any question, feel free to drop us an email in the [scala-ide-user ML][scala-ide-user-ml].

## Be Awesome, Contribute!

Did you consider contributing to the worksheet? Yes? What are you waiting for!? [Get 
in touch][scala-ide-user-ml] right now and help us driving the development of the 
worksheet! Really, the worksheet is actually a fairly simple Eclipse plug-in project, in a 
matter of hours you will be ready to start hacking your way and immediately deliver 
value. Still here? [Fork the project][project] on GitHub and be awesome!

## Thanks

We would like to take the opportunity to thank all contributors for the amazing work they 
have done to make this release possible. Special thanks go to Luc Bourlier, Mirco Dotta, 
Iulian Dragos, Martin Odersky and Amir Shaikhha.
