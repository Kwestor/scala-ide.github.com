After more than one year in development, we are very happy to announce the first release candidate of the next
Scala IDE for Eclipse! This release enjoys contributions from 23 different developers, and brings
an impressive number of new features and bugfixes.

Version 3.0 highlights include:

* [Semantic highlighting][sem-high]
* [Implicit highlighting][impl-high] and [hyperlinking][impl-hyper]
* [A Scala debugger][debugger]
* [More refactorings][new-refactor]
* A faster and more reponsive editor
* More reliable [JUnit test finder][junit-finder]
* An [ecosystem][ecosystem] of related plugins, with support for [Scalatest][scalatest] and a [Scala worksheet][scala-worksheet]
* [a lot more][changelog]

Without further ado, head down to the [download page][download] and get it!

# Editor improvements

The most visible feature in the new release is, no doubt, the new semantic highlighting: as you type, 
see if an identifier is a trait, a method, whether it's a mutable variable or it's been deprecated. While
this feature has been added in milestone 1, we've made crucial improvements in performance. Now you can
continue editing, and colors are added in the background as soon as the typing information becomes available.
Many thanks to Matt Russell for the initial implementation!

We spent a lot of time improving the editor. We spend most of the time in the editor, reading and writing code,
and it is essential that the editor is as smooth as possible. We polished many aspects of editing (scaladocs,
matching parenthesis, quick fixes, mark occurrences) but mostly focusing on making things faser and slimmer.
We believe that now editing is much faster and pleasant than ever before! Many thanks to Simon Schäfer, who
helped a great deal in improving the editor!

# Scala Debugger

Debugging is another fun activity for developers, and we wanted to improve on the already excellent Java debugging tools. Scala is
an incredibly rich language, and its translation to the JVM introduces compilation artifacts that sometime obscure
the original program. The Scala debugger helps by demangling names, showing the logical structure of usual Scala
collections, stepping over getters and setters (and a bunch of other artifacts), sane handling of for-loops and 
higher-order functions, etc. Compared to the last milestone, we made the debugger much faster and more robust.

# Plugins all the way down

In milestone 2 we introduced the Scala ecosystem, and we are very happy to see how that grows. Thanks to Chee Seng and
Bill Venners, Scala IDE users can now install the [ScalaTest plugin][scalatest] and run/debug and inspect `scalatest` fixtures
right in Eclipse.

The [worksheet][scala-worksheet] is another Scala IDE plugin, allowing a new breed of interaction with your project and the language.
A worksheet is a Scala file that is evaluated on save, and the result of each expression is shown in a column to the right of your program. Worksheets are like a REPL session on steroids, and enjoy 1st class editor support: completion, hyperlinking, interactive errors-as-you-type, auto-format, etc. Whether you want to explore a new library or just whip something up, the worksheet can make it fun. Don't miss it!

We will continue to work with plugin developers to integrate new and interesting plugins in the ecosystem.

## Installation

This release comes comes 4 different flavors: It supports Scala 2.9 and 2.10, and Eclipse Indigo (3.7) and Juno (4.2).

## A bit of statistics

This is the largest release of the Scala IDE so far, so let's have a look at some numbers:

* 647 closed tickets since 2.0
* 347 fixed tickets
* median time for a fix: 18 days
* ticket open for the longest time: [#2572](https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/2572) (1063 days)

We'd also like to take a moment and recognize the hard work of all contributors that helped shape this release. A huge thank you to all contributors and the great community around the Scala IDE for Eclipse!
