We are happy to announce the third release candidate for [Scala IDE 3.0][release-notes]. Compared to RC2, we have four changes:

* Fix for NPE in debugger variable view when using Eclipse Juno ([#1001585][#1001585])
* Expanding variable in debugger resulted in NPE ([#1001586][#1001586])
* Don't add arguments templates for parameterless method's completion ([#1001591][#1001591])
* Return `OK_STATUS` from the semantic highlighting job when the editor is dirty. ([#1001536][#1001536])

RC2 was affected by a serious regression in the new Scala Debugger (debugging with the Scala debugger was simply not working).
With this new RC3 the Scala Debugger is again fully operative.

We also upgraded to the latest Scala releases, 2.9.3 final and 2.10.1 final.

## Installation

This release comes comes 4 different flavors: It supports Scala 2.9 and 2.10, and Eclipse Indigo (3.7) and Juno (4.2).
