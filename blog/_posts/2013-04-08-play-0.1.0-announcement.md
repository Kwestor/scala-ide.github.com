The Scala IDE team is happy to announce a preview release of the Play2 support plugin in Scala IDE for Eclipse.

### Features

The plugin provides:
* a [Route files editor][route-editor], with syntax highlighting and formatting.
* a [Template files editor][template-editor], with syntax highlighting, code completion, error reporting, hovers, indentation.

Head over to the [project documentation][doc] for more details.

### Installation

The plugin is compatible with Play 2.1 applications, on Scala 2.10 or Java 1.5+. It should be installed on Scala IDE 3.0.0 for Scala 2.10, on both Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) and 4.2 (Juno).

It is available through the [Scala IDE ecosystem sites][download], the same as the ones used to install Scala IDE 3.0.0.

Follow [this guide][tutorial] for a step-by-step introduction to the development of Play2 application inside Scala IDE.

### Feedback

The plugin was tested on a limited range of play2 application configurations. If it seems to be incompatible with your setup, or if you notice other problems, please open a [ticket][tickets] with the relevant information or contact us on the [Scala IDE mailing list][mailing-list].

### Acknowledgments

The initial work was done by Amir Shaikhha. The effort was continued by the Scala IDE team and additional contributors: Iulian Dragos, Luc Bourlier, Mirco Dotta and Alden Torres.
