### Scala-IDE, with more plugin goodness ! ###

We have updated the [Scala-IDE ecosystem builder](https://github.com/scala-ide/ecosystem) ! [As previously](http://scala-ide.org/blog/scalatest-ecosystem.html), the Scala-IDE ecosystems are update sites for Eclipse, tailored for a particular flavor of your favorite set of tools: Scala, Scala-IDE and of course Eclipse.

But they also include fantastic **plugins**, in complete, **fully-integrated update sites** for Scala development. *Users* can head out to our [update sites](#Update-sites) to find additional tools like the [Scala worksheet](https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-worksheet/wiki/Getting-Started), [Scala-test](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_scalatest_with_eclipse), and look out for new additions, like [InSynth](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/insynth) or the [Play plugin](https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide-play2/wiki). Check back soon on our ecosystems, since we are constantly on the hunt for great Scala development plugins ... **perhaps for yours** !

Indeed, this is also exciting news for *plugin developers*: it's
now **even easier to add your plugin to Scala-IDE ecosystems** .
The process is outlined in the
[Contributor's guide](https://github.com/scala-ide/ecosystem/wiki/Contributor-guide),
and the more technical parts have been summarized in a
[short cheatsheet](https://github.com/scala-ide/ecosystem/wiki/Contributor%27s-cheatsheet). As
always, we love to help future contributors in the [Scala-IDE
development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-ide-dev) .

Consult [the ecosystem wiki](https://github.com/scala-ide/ecosystem/wiki) for **even more ecosystem goodness**: curated plugin distribution with categories, easier plugin maintenance for the forthcoming versions of Scala-IDE, etc !
