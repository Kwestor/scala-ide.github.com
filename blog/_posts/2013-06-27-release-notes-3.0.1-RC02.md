We are happy to announce Scala IDE 3.0.1-RC2, the second release candidate of the 3.0.1 maintenance release for Scala IDE, based on the recent Scala 2.10.2 release.

Compared with 3.0.1-RC1, we have one change :

* Run As shouldn't display an error when a binary Main can be found ([#1001760][1001760])

For the full list of updates, you can have a look at the [changelog].

It comes with a updated Scala worksheet and Play plugin.

*This release is available only for Scala 2.10.2*
