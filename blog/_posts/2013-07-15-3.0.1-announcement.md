We are happy to announce the release of Scala IDE 3.0.1, the first maintenance release of the 3.0 version, based on the recent **Scala 2.10.2** release.

## Improvements

Since the 3.0.0 release in March, 23 tickets were fixed. Some of the highlights are:

* correctly attach the Scala debugger to a running JVM, and support JRebel
* correctly use a configured JDK, other than the one used for running Eclipse
* correctly implemented Skip all breakpoints in the Scala debugger
* much cleaner **Open Type** dialog
* deprecation warnings accumulating

For the complete list of fixes, please see our [changelog][changelog].

## Ecosystem

In addition to Scala IDE, the update sites contains new versions of plugins related to Scala:

* Scala Worksheet 0.2.0
* Play support 0.3.0
* ScalaTest support 2.9.3
* InSynth 1.0.0
* Scala Search 0.1.0 <span class="label success">new</span>
