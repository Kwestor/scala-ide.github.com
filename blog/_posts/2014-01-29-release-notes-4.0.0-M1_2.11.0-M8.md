We are happy to give you a heads-up to the rebuild of our latest milestone of the Scala IDE, 4.0.0-M1, on the latest milestone from the Scala team, the new 2.11.0-M8.

## Improvements

The latest Scala milestone fixes more than a hundred issues, of which the IDE takes advantage for both stability and performance.

The complete list of changes is available in the [Scala announcement][scala-changelog].

Other fixes like these are in the works, and will become available as new versions of Scala are released. For the impatient, our [nightlies] always contain the latest fixes, as they are merged.

## Plugins

Living on the bleeding edge doesn't mean losing all confront. A new build of the Scala worksheet, compatible with the new release, is available. The corresponding build of Scala-search should come momentarily.

## Installation

This release is available for both Eclipse Juno (4.2) and Kepler (4.3) using the following update-site: [http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e38/scala211/dev/site/](http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e38/scala211/dev/site/).

Happy Scala coding!
