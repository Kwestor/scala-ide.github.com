We just released Scala IDE 4.0.0 RC2, fixing a regression that caused spurious errors during builds [#1002319](https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1002319). The full [release notes](/blog/release-notes-4.0.0-RC1.html) for more information about new and noteworthy features in 4.0, and the [changelog](/docs/changelog.html) for all the details.

You can upgrade your installation (or download a pre-packaged IDE) from the usual [download page](/download/milestone.html).
