We just released Scala IDE 4.0.0 RC3, fixing a few regressions before the final build. The full [release notes](/blog/release-notes-4.0.0-RC1.html) for more information about new and noteworthy features in 4.0, and the [changelog](/docs/changelog.html) for all the details.

In addition to fixing these few bugs, we added the ScalaTest plugin in the all-in-one bundle, for an even more complete out-of-the-box experience.

You can upgrade your installation (or download a pre-packaged IDE) from the usual [download page](/download/milestone.html).
