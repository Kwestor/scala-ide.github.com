<p>In this page we discuss the workflow for both external contributors and committers. The difference
between the two is very thin, and it boils down to having the rights for integrating patches (pull
requests, in GitHub terminology) in the mainline.</p>
<p>We assume you are comfortable with both Git and GitHub. If you need an introduction to these
essential tools, we suggest you to start by reading <a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/git-github.html#git-github-page"><em>Git &amp; GitHub</em></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="external-contributors">
<h2>External contributors<a class="headerlink" href="#external-contributors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you are an external contributor, the first thing you want to do is <a class="reference internal" href="../setup/setup.html#setup-fork-the-project"><em>forking the Scala IDE
repository</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<p>In your own fork, you are clearly free to adopt the workflow that better suits you. Though, the
moment you decide to send a pull request (so that your changes can be integrated in the Scala IDE
project), you need to make sure that both the branch name and your code match the required standards.
That is why we suggest you to follow the conventions discussed in this section also in your
own fork, it will just make it simpler and faster to push your changes in the main project.</p>
<p>There are two, very simple, steps that you should do before starting any work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, discuss with the core dev team what you would like to work on. There are several reasons
why you should do this, but mainly it is about making sure that everyone knows what you are doing,
so that we can avoid duplicating effort (which would be indeed a shame), and you may get some precious
feedback, which can help you being more effective and avoid wasting time. As usual, to get in
touch just drop a note in the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/group/scala-ide-dev?hl=en">scala-ide-dev</a> mailing list.</li>
<li>Second, make sure that a ticket describing the defect/feature you want to tackle exists in our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets">Assembla issue tracker</a>. If you
can&#8217;t find one, just go ahead and create it. Once you have a ticket, assign it to you. In short,
we would like defect/enhancement/feature to be driven by tickets as much as possible, as this
help us keeping track of changes between each release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, now it&#8217;s time to create a new branch (standard git workflow).</p>
<div class="section" id="branch-name-convention">
<span id="workflow-branch-name-convention"></span><h3>Branch name convention<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-name-convention" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The convention for naming a branch is straightforward, the name should convey what the branch is
about (i.e., a short description) and the ticket number should be suffixed. Words are separated by
dashes (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt>). For instance, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scala-java-interop-1000508</span></tt> is a perfectly valid name.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ready-to-push-your-changes">
<h3>Ready to push your changes?<a class="headerlink" href="#ready-to-push-your-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you are done working on a ticket, make sure that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your code is clean and documented. And you have made your best effort to decouple UI elements from
core logic (that enables you to create tests for the core logic).</li>
<li>You have done your best to create a set of tests that exercise the implemented feature. (Read
<a class="reference internal" href="../testing/testing.html#testing-regression-test-suite"><em>Regression Test Suite</em></a> for learning how to create tests for the Scala IDE).</li>
<li>Your branch compiles against Scala 2.9.x and 2.10 (read <a class="reference internal" href="../building/building.html#building-run-the-build"><em>Run the build</em></a> for
learning how to build the Scala IDE with different versions of Scala). Of course, that also
implies all tests succeeded.</li>
<li>Rebase your branch on the latest upstream (read <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow">here</a> for more information on how to do this).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get stuck with any of the above, just write a note in the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/group/scala-ide-dev?hl=en">scala-ide-dev</a> mailing list. We are very keen in making
sure you can integrate your awesome work back in the project&#8217;s mainline, so we will be very happy
to help you fix any of the above points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="send-us-a-pull-request">
<h3>Send us a pull request<a class="headerlink" href="#send-us-a-pull-request" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you think your work is ready to be integrated, send us a pull request (read <a class="reference external" href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">here</a> for how
to do this). When sending a pull request, contributors will review your code. There might be a few
iterations (code review, update code) before your pull request is merged in the mainline. Don&#8217;t get
discouraged, we absolutely want your code to be in the mainline, but we also need to make sure that
the quality standards are met. In the end, all we want is simply a better Scala IDE and a nice
codebase, so that we can make it as simple as possible for new contributors to enter the project.</p>
<p>Of course, after sending a pull request, you can immediately start working on a new task ;)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="committers">
<h2>Committers<a class="headerlink" href="#committers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This section assumes that you know how the <a class="reference internal" href="../repository-organization/repository-organization.html#repository-organization-page"><em>repository is organized</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The workflow for committers is very similar to the one described in the above
<a class="reference internal" href="#external-contributors">External contributors</a> section, with the only difference that you don&#8217;t need to fork the project
and you can push your branches directly in the main Scala IDE git repository.</p>
<p>It is easy to decide where your branch should live:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are experimenting a new idea, create it under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">experimental</span></tt>.</li>
<li>If you want to work on a defect/enhancement/feature, create it under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">issue</span></tt>. If you can&#8217;t find
a ticket describing what you want to work on, create a new one before starting to do any work. For
each branch created under issue it is mandatory to have a ticket linked to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, we expect to have very few (possibly none at all) branches living in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">experimental</span></tt>, as we
would like defect/enhancement/feature to be driven by tickets as much as possible.</p>
<p>Branches should be named using the same convention described in <a class="reference internal" href="#workflow-branch-name-convention"><em>Branch name convention</em></a>.</p>
<p>When creating a new branch under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">issue</span></tt>, you should push your branch remotely as soon as
possible. Don&#8217;t be afraid of sharing bad code, none will blame you for that. The only moment when
code quality does matter is when you ask to merge your changes into the mainline (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></tt>
branch). Until that moment you are free of committing almost anything on your own branch (but please
do not push binaries in remote branches, as they will considerably increase the repository&#8217;s
footprint).</p>
<p>When you are done working on a branch, create a pull request for it.</p>
<p>Once the review process is over, you are good to merge. But before doing so, you need to know on
what branches you should merge to. In general, you will always need to merge with master. Though,
depending on the ticket you have been working on, you may also want to merge in one of the release
branches.</p>
<p>A new release branch is created when it is time to start working on stabilizing the Scala IDE for a
final release. For instance, at the time of this writing, work is being done for releasing 2.0.0.
Consequently, when working on a ticket with its Milestone set to 2.0, you will always need to merge
your work with both master and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scala-ide-2.0.x</span></tt>. If the ticket&#8217;s Milestone is not 2.0, you may still
be allowed to merge in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scala-ide-2.0.x</span></tt> release branch, depending on the content of your changes.
The best way to know whether you should merge in a release branch is, again, to open a discussion in
the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/group/scala-ide-dev?hl=en">scala-ide-dev</a> mailing list.</p>
<p>The following are the steps you should follow when your work is ready to be integrated in the
mainline:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>before merging, rebase your branch (this step is optional, but it keeps the repository&#8217;s history cleaner),</li>
<li>merge your branch into master (and in a release branch if needed. Look at the ticket&#8217;s Milestone field),</li>
<li>close the ticket, and</li>
<li>delete the remote branch associated with the above closed ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you are ready to hack on a new ticket ;)</p>
<p>If anything above is unclear, please make sure to ask in the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/group/scala-ide-dev?hl=en">scala-ide-dev</a> mailing list for clarification.</p>
