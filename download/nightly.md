## Get the Development Version!
The nightly builds allow you to follow the development of both Scala IDE and Scala. Builds of the 2.1 version of the Scala IDE for both Scala 2.9 and and Scala trunk (2.10) are available. Because it is currently not possible to install both plug-ins within the same Eclipse installation, you need to decide what version of Scala you want to be using and then choose the appropriate build.
